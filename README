== Execution

Run robots from the root directory of the project.  Set the environment as a shell variable:
ROBOT_ENVIRONMENT=development WORKFLOW_CONFIG_HOME=/path/to/robot_root_dir/config/workflows ./robots/google_scanned_book/descriptive_metadata.rb

Default is local

TODO
-maybe define a ROBOT_ROOT constant in boot.rb?
	-lyber_core/workflow might need to read in workflow config directory relative from ROBOT_ROOT
-maybe make all robots executable shell scripts?
	-First line: #!/usr/bin/env ruby
	-Remove .rb
	-chmod 755
