Feature: Deposit an object into Sedora
  In order to deposit an object
  As a depositor
  I want to know that all parts of the ingest workflow are behaving correctly

  Scenario: New Object
    When I create a new object
    # Then I should see a search field
    #    And I should see a selectable list with field choices
    #    And I should see a "search" button
    #    And I should not see the "startOverLink" element
    #    And I should see "Welcome!"
    #    And I should see a stylesheet
